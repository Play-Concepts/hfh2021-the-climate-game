# The Climate Game

A Flutter application created during the [Hack From Home 2021 - DeCarbonisation](https://hackfromhome.com).

It aims to share information about Climate Change and Other Environmental Issues through firstly Quizzes 
and in the future through more advanced Gamifications.

It is ultimately targeted at children.

## Privacy Concerns
The application is extended with Dataswift's Personal Data Accounts technology https://dataswift.io

Authentication is performed against the PDA and all usage data and scores are stored in the PDA.
